Google's Workbox: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/

Workbox is a collection of libraries and build tools that make it easy to store your website’s files locally, on your users’ devices. Consider Workbox if you want to:
* Make your site work offline.
* Improve load performance on repeat-visits. Even if you don’t want to go fully-offline, you can use Workbox to store and serve common files locally, rather than from the network.

Google's Lighthouse: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/

Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.

Note: You can use Vue.js in a React application by having a div or element to attach the Vue to.
