#Simplicity is Vuetiful

Michael Bennet
from Rangle.io

The Case for Vue:
* Easy onboarding
* Only need to have basic to intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, as well as a good text editor and a browser
* Don't need to know npm, cli, or scaffolding basics
* Good docs
* Is flexible
* Has an official ecosystem
    * Core
    * Routing
    * State Management
    * Template Compilation
    * SSR
